        ![screen-shot](scsht.png)
        pyMine is an open-source module for Python, helps you to create or play old classic Windows Mine game in Python Terminal enviorment.
        
        # How to install?
        
        ## pip
        
            pip install pymine
        
        # How to play?
        
        After installing module, you need to import it.
        
            import pymine
        
           pyMine module includes **mine_engine** class, **clear_terminal** function and **COLOR** class.
           create a **mine_engine** object.
        
        
            game = mine_engine(row=10,col=10,mines_count=20)
        
        if you wish to define row,col and number of mines later, feel free to leave inputs empty, lator you can set or edit values by:
        
         - num_mines -> int
         - map_size(row,col) -> function
        
        After defining mine attributes, first we need to create game board and build cells, then we have to generate mines into board cell.
        
            game.create_map() #this will build up game map.
            game.generate_mines() #this will generate mines and put them into game board.
        
        **It's better not to change any of the attributes while playing to prevent any errors.**
        
        After all these, you can now print out the game board.
        
            game.print_map()
        
        so now you can start playing, use flag(row,col) to flag a cell, use click(row,col) to choose and click on a cell, it will reveale number of mines around or it will explode!
        
        **Have fun!**
